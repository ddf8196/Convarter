# Convarter
An android app that allows you to edit Minecraft (MCPE) gamemaps with javascripts, create customized flat levels and other features.

Now supports gamemap editing using BlockLauncher-style javascripts.
* `getTile(x,y,z)` returns block id. (Not yet)
* `getData(x,y,z)` returns block data. (Not yet)
* `setTile(x,y,z,id)` sets the block's id.
* `setTile(x,y,z,id,data)` sets the block's id and data.
* `setData(x,y,z,data)` sets the block's data. (Not yet)

With this app you can generate huge and complex things in Minecraft that are hard
or impossible to be build manually or using in-game scripts.  
This app has a previous version which was made several years ago that already
made popular game maps uploaded to MCPE Master.
